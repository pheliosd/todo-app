//Class Component
import React from "react"

function  ThirdComponent(){
    return (
        <div className="c3">
            Third Component
        </div>
    );
}
//best way to declare exports , and this will help in the case of multiple components
export default ThirdComponent
//avoid semicolon as much as possible
//
// export default app;
